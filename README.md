# Practice coding problems in Python/Java/Kotlin

I practice solving hackerrank type of questions in Python. <br>
I have also started preparing for an Android developer interview, so I will practice/revise with some small Java/Kotlin projects. <br>
Need some place to keep myself accountable and track my progress. <br>
