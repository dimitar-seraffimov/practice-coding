This repository is entirely dedicated to coding practice and interview questions preparation.

## Machine Learning Institute

I have found an educational programme that sparked interest in me, link to the programme - https://programme.mlx.institute/
There is a programme starting 27th Jan but I have a uni responsibilities now, hope to get in the programme starting 31st March.
Lot's of time to prepare!

## '75 Leetcode'

Practicing hackerrank type of questions in Python. <br>
Need some place to keep myself accountable and track my progress. <br>

## 'Android-ChessApp' - archived

Preparing for an Android developer interview, so I have practiced & revised with some small Java/Kotlin projects. <br>
I have(had) a week to prepare.
Developed a small chess app (using Kotlin), I have implemented the fundamentals:

- basic movement rules for all pieces (straight/diagonal)
- movement restrictions and identify possible moves for each piece, based on the current game state
- player turn switching and move validation
- interactive chessboard UI, with drag-and-drop functionality for piece movement

![UI Progress](Android-DEV-preparation/UI_Progress_11.18.2024.png)

potential TODO list:

- logic for detecting check, checkmate, and stalemate
  - detect edge cases (insufficient material, threefold repetition, and fifty-move rule)
- display elapsed game time
- score panel indicating captured pieces for each side
- 'Home Screen' for navigating game options
  - connect screens for In-Game play and Previous Games history

The project is much fun, I really enjoy working on mobile applications.
I plan a new project so I will start working on it soon.

## 'svg-colour-editor' - archived

A friend of mine asked me if I could clear some colours from a .svg file. Had to research how it works, it is actually pretty straightforward.
Now I have a program that can remove colours from a .svg file and save the new file.
Fun exercise.
