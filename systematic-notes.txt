I am taking detailed notes on paper for each tutorial video I watch. 
I will add them systematically here to keep track of progress and solutions logic.

01. 'Two Sum' - Leetcode 1
  -> using hashmap to store the index of the elements
  -> if the difference of target and current element is present in the hashmap, return the indices
  -> else, add the current element to the hashmap
  -> Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

02. 'Best time to buy and sell stock' - Leetcode 121
  -> pointers to keep track of the minimum price and maximum profit
  -> if the current price is less than the minimum price, update the minimum price
  -> else, update the maximum profit if the difference between the current price and minimum price is greater than the maximum profit
  -> Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

03. 'Contains Duplicate' - Leetcode 217
  -> using a hashset to store the elements
  -> if the element is already present in the hashset, return true
  -> else, add the element to the hashset
  -> Time complexity: O(1), Space complexity: O(n)

04. 'Product of Array Except Self' - Leetcode 238
  -> using prefix and postfix arrays, compute all prefix products and update directly the result array to save space 
  -> calculate the postfix result and multiply it with the prefix result to get the final result
  -> Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

05. 'Maximum Subarray' - Leetcode 53
  -> using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray
  -> keep track of the maximum sum and current sum
  -> if the current sum is less than 0, reset the current sum to 0
  -> update the maximum sum if the current sum is greater than the maximum sum
  -> return the maximum sum
  -> Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)
06. 'Maximum Product Subarray' - Leetcode 152

07. 'Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array' - Leetcode 153
